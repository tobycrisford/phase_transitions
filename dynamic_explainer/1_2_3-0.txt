<p>Close to the critical temperature (2.77) the correlation length of the thermal fluctuations becomes
very large. At the critical temperature itself, it becomes infinite (or at least would on an infinite lattice).
The fluctuations take on a scale invariant, fractal structure.</p>

<p>This is an example of a second order phase transition.
Below the critical temperature, the symmetry is broken and we have a bias towards one state over the other.
Above the critical temperature, the symmetry is restored.</p>
