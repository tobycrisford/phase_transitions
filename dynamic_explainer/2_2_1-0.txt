Close to the ... transition, you can spot vortex/anti-vortex pairs being spontaneously created, and then quickly
annihilated, interfering with the long range correlations.

A 'vortex' is a special arrangement of arrows. It has a center point. As you move in a complete circle around the center point,
the direction of the arrows rotates by exactly 360 degrees (e.g. from green to blue to red to green again if you move clockwise).
Vortices are special. First, although there is a large energy cost near the center of the vortex where arrows point in very
different directions to their neighbours, this large energy cost is confined to a small region. The energy cost further away from the center
is much smaller, and becomes negligible at large distances. So vortices don't cost too much energy to form. Second, once you have a vortex,
it is very hard to get rid of it. Consider an arrow that is part of the vortex. It is being pulled one way by the arrows to its left,
but the opposite way by the arrows to its right. This makes the arrangement very stable. It is an example of a 'topological defect'.

The only way to get rid of a vortex is to collide it with an 'anti-vortex' (which is just a vortex where the winding goes the other way,
from green to red to blue to green).
