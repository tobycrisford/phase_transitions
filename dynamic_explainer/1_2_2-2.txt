At low temperatures, the symmetry is broken, and the majority of pixels occupy the same state, possibly with small thermal 
fluctuations on top. It may take some time to settle down to this arrangmeent though.
You may first see a region of one colour slowly eroded by a larger region of the other.
There is one possible exception to this behaviour that you might also rarely see.
Because our grid is periodic, it effectively has the topology of a torus (a doughnut).
If a region of one state wraps around the hole of the doughnut, then it can become very hard to get rid of.
One of its boundaries has effectively disappeared. If the remaining boundary becomes a straight line,
then we end up with a very stable configuration. The pixels on either side of the boundary have their states
protected by the three states around them on their own side. There are no longer any corners where the smaller
region can be attacked by the larger.
